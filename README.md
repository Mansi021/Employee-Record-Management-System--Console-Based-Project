# Employee-Record-Management-System--Console-Based-Project

In todayâ€™s world of advancing technologies, everything has become computerised so human work/manual work is now becoming a bit more specific and mostly work is done by computers.Since it is very difficult to maintain the employee record on paper, there is a need for a record system which can store the data of the employee. Employee Record System is basically a simple program that helps the user to add,list and store the data of all the employees. Basic necessity is to create a database where the records and data of the employees can be stored and updated according to the need of the organisation.
